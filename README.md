| | **Microservices and the 12-factor app** <br/><br/> This webinar walks us through the history of software architectural design and takes a look at the components of a 12-factor application and why they work so well in a highly distributed Cloud environment? <br/><br/> [Slides](events/Microservices101.pdf) <br/><br/> -Jennifer Bergstrom, _Cloud Services Team Lead_ |
| | **Discover Chaos Engineering** <br/><br/> As systems become very larger, more distributed, and more complex, effectively testing those systems becomes ever more challenging. Building a test environment that is similar to the production environment is simply not possible in widely distributed systems like those hosted in public cloud environments. So how can we prove that our systems are capable, resilient and fault-tolerant? Through the use of Chaos Engineering! This webinar walks us through the history, benefits, strategies for implementation of, tools and best practices for Chaos Engineering. <br/><br/> [Slides](events/ChaosEngineering.pdf) <br/><br/> -Jennifer Bergstrom, _Cloud Services Team Lead_ |
| | **Kafka 101 and Event Driven Architecture** <br/><br/> Join Women Who Code and our speaker Amanda Gilbert from Confluent, for a technical overview and introduction to Kafka, and real world applications of Event Driven Architecture. <br/><br/> [Slides](events/Amanda_Gilbert_Kafka_101.pdf) <br/><br/> [Video Recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SnnUjykWdI)<br/><br/> -Amanda Gilbert |

Members will walk through guided exam material overviews, hands on labs , practices tests and lots of discussion points. This journey will not only help prepare you to pass the exam, but we will also build on our community experience to apply our learnings to real world projects.<br/><br/> [Register](https://us02web.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_p9FbnOp-Qjq2oB3bLgEewA)<br/><br/> -Bri Augenreich, _Master Software Engineer_ |

Data mesh is a new approach to handling large amounts of data at scale within an organization. This session focuses on the application code of a data product that ingests data via its input port, processes it and produces output at its output port. <br/><br/> [Video Recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwuGPrxeZ2w)<br/><br/> -Samia Rahman and Alpesh Pandya, _Thoughtworks_ |
